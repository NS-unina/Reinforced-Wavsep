# Reinforced-Wavsep 
A reinforced version of the Wavsep evaluation platform.

* Added ≃  80 GET/POST new cases:

	- Reflected XSS
	- Blind Sql Injection
	- Obfuscation Sql Injection
	- Union Sql Injection
	- XML External Entity
	- Path Traversal
	- OS Command Injection

* Homepage and pages restyling.
* Integrated the WAVSEP benchmark version 1.7

* Added jar libraries for use with mysql 8.0.22 and to execute new XSS and SQLI scenarios (e.g. sectooladdict.jar).

* Solved some bugs.     

## Benchmark test cases
The environment is actually composed of *1405 vulnerable test cases*: 
* 116 vulnerable Reflected XSS test cases;
* 4 vulnerable DOM XSS test cases;
* 158 vulnerable SQL Injection test cases;
* 748 vulnerable Local File Inclusion test cases;   
* 108 vulnerable,  Remote File Inclusione test cases;  
* 120 vulnerable OS-Command-Injection test cases; 
* 60 vulnerable Unvalidated Redirect test cases;   
* 12 vulnerable Xml External Entity test cases;   

The benchmark also contains *40 non-vulnerable test cases*:  
* 7 non-vulnerable Reflected Cross-Site-Scripting test cases;
* 10 non-vulnerable SQL Injection test cases;
* 8 non-vulnerable Local File Inclusion test cases; 
* 6 non-vulnerable Remote File Inclusion test cases; 
* 9 non-vulnerable Unvalidated Redirect test cases; 


# WAVSEP - The Web Application Vulnerability Scanner Evaluation Project

WAVSEP is vulnerable web application designed to help assessing the features, quality and accuracy of web application vulnerability scanners.
This evaluation platform contains a collection of unique vulnerable web pages that can be used to test the various properties of web application scanners.

## Installation    
### Modern approach
1. Install docker and docker-compose: 
- https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/ 
- https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/        


To use it with `docker-compose`: 
``` 
docker-compose up   # docker compose up   
```   


To use it with `docker`:   
```  
docker network create wavsep-net
docker run --rm -d --net wavsep-net --name wavsepdb nsunina/wavsep-db:v1.8 
docker run --rm -d --net wavsep-net -p 18080:8080 --name wavsep nsunina/wavsep:v1.8
```   


The wavsep will run on `http://0.0.0.0:18080` .     

To stop it:  
``` 
docker-compose down    
```
if you are using `docker-compose`, otherwise:   
```   
docker rm -f wavsep
docker rm -f wavsepdb
docker network rm wavsep-net
```

## Development mode 
To run in development mode: 
- Compile the project: `mvn compile`
- Run docker-compose with the following command: 
``` 
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up
```


When you change the code, recompile the project, and run the following: 
```
mvn package
```

All the changes will be updated.



### Old style approach
(1) Download & Install OpenJdk (suggested >= 11.x).<br/>
(2) Download & install Apache Tomcat (suggested >= 8.x).<br/>
(3) Download & install MySQL Community Server 8.0.22 (sudo apt install mysql-server).<br/>
(3) Copy the wavsep.war file into the tomcat webapps directory.<br/>
(4) Restart the application server.<br/>
<br/>
Example of installation with new setup (January 2021):<br/>
<br/>
(1) JDK:
```bash
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk
export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-11-openjdk-amd64
java --version
```
(2) Apache Tomcat:
```bash
mkdir /opt/tomcat
cd /opt/tomcat
wget http://apache.spinellicreations.com/tomcat/tomcat-8/v8.5.32/bin/apache-tomcat-8.5.32.tar.gz
tar xvzf apache-tomcat-8.5.32.tar.gz
export CATALINA_HOME=/opt/tomcat/apache-tomcat-8.5.32
~/.bashrc
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh
```
(3) MySQL Community Server:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mysql-server
sudo mysql_secure_installation (During installation select 'N', 0, enter root password, 'Y')
systemctl status mysql.service
```
   

(4) Build the wavsep application and copy it in the tomcat folder

Create the package with `mvn package`  and copy the wavsep.war file into the tomcat webapps directory (with git):
```bash
cd /opt/tomcat/webapps/
mv /path/to/wavsep.war/ .
```
(ii) Restart the application server:
```bash
$CATALINA_HOME/bin/startup.sh

or

cd/opt/tomcat/bin/
./startup.sh
```

## Usage    
Run the environment with the modern or old-style approach, then the wavsep benchmark is available at the following link:   

```
http://0.0.0.0:18080
```

Now you can configure the database:  
```http://127.0.0.1:18080/wavsep/wavsep-install/index.jsp`  

- **Username**: root 
- **Password**: pass 
- **Database**: wavsepdb



Although some of the test cases are vulnerable to additional exposures, the purpose of each test case is to evaluate the detection accuracy of one type of exposure, and thus, “out of scope” exposures should be ignored when evaluating the accuracy of vulnerability scanners.

**Note:** To use SQLI labs correctly there is a .jsp page whose purpose is to create and populate the necessary database tables. To do this, visit the URL "**/wavsep/wavsep-install/install.jsp**", and follow instructions.   


## Utility scripts   
The repo includes a `utils` folder that contains several utility modules:  
* A crawler that allows to run all the tests.  
* A `print_requests.py` module that can be used to print all the requests.   
* A `expected_results_generator.py` module that can be used to generate a `csv` file compliant with the OWASP Benchmarking Utility suite.   



To run the crawler: 
```  
usage: run_crawler.py [-h] [proxy-host] [proxy-port] [category] [harfile]

Run crawler

positional arguments:
  proxy-host
  proxy-port
  category
  harfile

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit  
```  

The crawler requires a running instance on `localhost:18080`

To print the requests:  
```  
usage: print_requests.py [-h] [category] [harfile]

Run crawler

positional arguments:
  category
  harfile

options:
  -h, --help  show this help message and exit  
  ```     

  ### wavsep-utils.sh 
  An utility script: 
  `source wavsep-utils.sh` to enable the several functions. 
  Then you can use the following commands:
* `print_sql`: to print the sql test cases

## Troubleshooting 
### [ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-war-plugin:3.3.2:war (default-war) on project wavsep-enhancement: Error assembling WAR: .../target/wavsep-enhancement-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT.war isn't a file. 
To fix it, check if the `wavsep-enhancement-xxx` is a folder, and remove it. 
```
rm -rf target/wavsep-enhancement-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT*
```


### Error response from daemon: failed to create task for container: 
```failed to create shim task: OCI runtime create failed: runc create failed: unable to start container process: error during container init: error mounting "...Wavsep/target/wavsep-enhancement-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT.war" to rootfs at "/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/wavsep.war": mount /.../Reinforced-Wavsep/target/wavsep-enhancement-1.8.1-SNAPSHOT.war:/usr/local/tomcat/webapps/wavsep.war (via /proc/self/fd/6), flags: 0x5000: not a directory: unknown: Are you trying to mount a directory onto a file (or vice-versa)? Check if the specified host path exists and is the expected type```

To fix this error, run `docker-compose down` and then restart with the steps described in the development mode.
